# Managing Versions

Use [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install). You can download java (and other tools) versions directly from it, or add already downloaded versions into SDKMAN. You can set default, and local versions using terminal.

To set java version of project inside vscode type `Java: Configure Runtime` command in command palette.
